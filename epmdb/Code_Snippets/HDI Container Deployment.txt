---------------------------

xs mtas -- to display all the MTA in the system

 xs deploy c:\location\filename .mtar
 xs undeploy <mta>
 
 -- this undeploy command only removes the latest MTA version that is installed, but can't go beyond that. 
 
 -- in case if you wanted to go to a very old version, then you may take the MTAR and deploy it again.
